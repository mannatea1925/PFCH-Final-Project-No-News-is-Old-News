# PFCH-Final-Project-No-News-is-Old-News

No News is Old News demonstrates the potential to use newspaper APIs as an information literacy tool to explore historic events and their development as news stories, bias in reporting, and the dissemination of information.
We use the New York Times API and The Guardian API to compare coverage across two international, English-first news outlets. You can find their documentation here:
-        New York Times Developer Network (we use the ArticleSearch API in our examples) https://developer.nytimes.com/
-        The Guardianâ€™s Open Platform https://open-platform.theguardian.com
The NYTimes Developer Network offers several access points/sub-collections to query, whereasThe Guardian is presented as one API that can be queried a few different ways. We wrote the returned data to json files for review.

See samplecompare.docx for an example of how to use the code and interpret the results with respect to information literacy. 

* Please note that we have removed our API keys from our code files. Sign-up for your own API key for free via their individual resource links above.
